      <p>
        Even though weâ€™re miles apart, youâ€™re the first thing on my mind today. I hope your day is as wonderful as you
        are, and filled with all the happiness and laughter you deserve.

        I wish I could be there to celebrate with you, but Iâ€™m sending all my best wishes. Letâ€™s plan to meet up
        soonâ€”maybe even celebrate together then?

        Have a great birthday, and remember: you have someone thinking of you and cheering you on from afar. ðŸ˜‰

        Take care of yourself and enjoy your special day!
